# Power analysis in cluster randomized trials
R package created to determine the required sample size in different designs of cluster randomised trialswhen using the Bayes factor. The method implemented is based on simulating datasets, fitting multilevel models, and calculating the Approximated Adjusted Fractional Bayes Factor.
